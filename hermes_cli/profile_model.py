"""Profile main-model assignment helpers (extracted from web_server).

Shared by the TUI profile methods and (historically) the dashboard's profile
routers. These write the main ``model:`` slot into a specific profile's
``config.yaml`` and the normalization helpers they rely on. Kept as a small,
standalone module so callers that no longer import the dashboard backend
(still, TUI) can resolve them without pulling in ``hermes_cli.web_server``.

def _normalize_main_model_assignment(provider: str, model: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """Normalize a main-slot (provider, model) pair before persisting.

    The Models page has two assignment paths and only one of them was safe:

    - The "Change" picker sends a real Hermes provider slug — fine.
    - The per-card "Use as → Main model" menu sends ``entry.provider``
      from the analytics rows, falling back to the model's VENDOR prefix
      (``modelVendor("anthropic/claude-opus-4.6") == "anthropic"``) when
      the session row has no ``billing_provider`` (older sessions, NULL
      rows).  That wrote ``provider: anthropic`` +
      ``default: anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`` to config — a vendor-prefixed
      OpenRouter slug on the NATIVE Anthropic provider.  New sessions then
      400 against api.anthropic.com ("model: anthropic/claude-opus-4.6 not
      found") and the user reads it as "changing models does nothing".

    Two repairs, both at this single chokepoint so every caller inherits:

    1. Vendor-name → Hermes-provider mapping: when the provider string is
       not a known Hermes provider/alias (e.g. ``moonshotai``, ``x-ai`` is
       known but ``poolside`` isn't) but the model is a vendor-prefixed
       aggregator slug, keep the user's CURRENT aggregator if they're on
       one, else fall back to openrouter.

       Named custom providers (``custom:litellm``, etc.) are excluded from
       this fallback: ``_KNOWN_PROVIDER_NAMES`` only lists the bare
       ``"custom"`` bucket, never a specific ``custom:<name>`` slug, so
       without this exclusion every named custom provider paired with a
       slash-bearing model (e.g. ``ollama/glm-5.2`` behind a LiteLLM proxy)
       looked exactly like the stray-vendor-prefix case above and got
       silently reassigned to ``openrouter``.
    2. Model-format normalization for the resolved provider via
       ``normalize_model_for_provider`` (e.g. ``anthropic/claude-opus-4.6``
       on native anthropic → ``claude-opus-4-6``).

    Sets ``provider``/``default``, then reconciles ``base_url``:

    - An explicitly supplied ``base_url`` is always persisted (covers
      ``custom``/local endpoints and any provider whose key is bound to a
      non-default host).
    - Otherwise, a stale ``base_url`` is cleared ONLY when switching to a
      *different* provider — that URL belonged to the old provider. When the
      provider is unchanged and no new URL is supplied, the existing

      alive when they merely re-pick a model under the same provider — picking
      a model previously wiped it, forcing the registry default and breaking
      Token Plan keys.

    The runtime resolver reads ``model.base_url`` from config (it ignores
    ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``) and only honors it when the configured provider matches
    and the pool entry is on the registry default, so preserving it here is what
    lets the override actually route. The hardcoded ``context_length`` override
    is always dropped since the new model may have a different context window.
