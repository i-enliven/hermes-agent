"""Concurrent-Hermes-instance detection (Windows .exe-holder hygiene).

Survivor of the TASK-03 3c dashboard/serve removal: this single helper is
reused by ``hermes update`` to detect other live processes that hold a
lock on the venv entry-point shims (``hermes.exe`` /
``hermes-gateway.exe``), which Windows would otherwise block on during an
update. Everything else in this module (dashboard/serve process scanning,
killing, respawning, and the desktop-ssh remote lock-dir family) belonged
to the dashboard/serve backend and was removed.

    """Find other live processes whose .exe is one of our entry-point shims.

    Windows blocks DELETE/REPLACE on a running .exe — and even RENAME on the
    same .exe when another process opened it without ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE``.
    The Hermes Desktop Electron app spawns ``hermes.EXE`` as a backend child,
    so during ``hermes update`` the user-invoked process and the desktop's
    child both hold the same file. The quarantine rename then fails with
    ``[WinError 32]`` and uv inherits the lock.

    This helper enumerates processes whose ``exe`` matches one of the venv's
    shims (``hermes.exe`` / ``hermes-gateway.exe``) and returns ``(pid,
    process_name)`` pairs. The caller's own PID and its entire ancestor
    chain are excluded so the running ``hermes update`` invocation never
    reports itself — this matters on Windows where the setuptools .exe
    launcher (``hermes.exe``) is a separate process from the Python
    interpreter it loads (``python.exe``).

    Returns an empty list off-Windows, on missing psutil, or when no other
    instances exist. Never raises — process enumeration is best-effort.

    #      first psutil error (AccessDenied/NoSuchProcess is common on Windows
    #      across session/elevation boundaries), leaving the launcher shim in
    #      the candidate set and re-triggering the false positive.
    #   2. Only exclude ancestors whose exe is itself a shim. A genuine second
    #      hermes.exe sitting *under* a non-Hermes parent (e.g. a Hermes
    #      Desktop backend child) must still be flagged, so we don't blanket-
    #      exclude unrelated ancestors like the shell or terminal.
